# Gym Management System

A robust web application for managing gym operations, built with React (frontend), Flask (backend), and PostgreSQL (database), featuring role-based access for users, trainers, and admins.

By David Chumo and Adreen Githinji

## Description

This application streamlines gym management by providing a platform where users can register, log in, and track their subscriptions, attendance, and health profiles. Trainers can manage classes and trainees, while admins oversee users, trainers, and subscription plans. The system leverages a live backend API built with Flask and a PostgreSQL database, ensuring a persistent and scalable experience. It showcases advanced front-end development concepts like React routing, form handling with Formik and Yup, and Tailwind CSS for responsive design.

## Features

  * **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login for users, trainers, and admins with role-based access.
  * **User Dashboard**: Displays subscription plans, trainer details, attendance history, and class RSVPs with days left on subscriptions.
  * **Trainer Dashboard**: Allows trainers to create and manage workout classes and view their assigned trainees.
  * **Admin Dashboard**: Enables admins to create, edit, and delete users, trainers, and subscription plans, plus assign trainers to users.
  * **Subscription Management**: Users can register for plans, with restrictions preventing overlap, and admins can define new plans.
  * **Attendance Tracking**: Features a GitHub-like calendar to visualize attendance and real-time marking.
  * **Class RSVP System**: Users can RSVP for classes, with trainers managing class schedules.
  * **Responsive Design**: A modern, interactive UI that adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using Tailwind CSS.
  * **Real-Time Updates**: Seamless data fetching and updates via API calls to the Flask backend.
